python + braces + semicolons

I want to enhance the language a little bit.

This attempt is simple and just for fun. But Python is really bad in some aspects, such as the reference semantic, mutable etc.

To add such feature I need to extend the script to a more complicated one and I am not going to do this. It hurts.
